            <h2>Zeus</h2>
            <p>Zeus is the King of the gods, yougest of 6 born of Rhea and Cronos, he is married to his sister Hera, Queen of the gods. He is the god of lightning and the sky. Due to the many very differning accounts of Zeus and how many children he had and with who only the children who are mostly agreed upon by the masses will be included so most of his supposed children are going to be atributed to others. For example Aphrodite in one story is a daughter of Uranus but in anther story she is the daughter of Zeus and Dione.</p>
